# Sistemas Inteligentes para Bioinformática

## Mestrado em Bioinformática, Universidade do Minho, 2021-2022.

A library of machine learning algorithms to grasp essential concepts on a ML curriculum.
Only the basic modules and classes should be provided to students. 
The aim it that they should build their own implementations of refence ML algorithms using a common API.
The best way of learning something is to implement it.

`git clone https://github.com/vmspereira/si.git`

`cd si`

`pip install -e .`

The _src_ folder contains the base source over which you will implement you code.

The _tests_ folder are python tests for continuous integration.

The _dataset_ folder contains some illustrative datasets.

The _script_ folder contains some notbooks to test your code.

Please, refer to this github when used for any purpose.
