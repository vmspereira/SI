# Sistemas Inteligentes para Bioinformática

## Mestrado em Bioinformática, Universidade do Minho, 2021-2022.

A library of algorithms to grasp essential concepts on a Machine Learning curriculum.
The code is commented with the mathematical fundations needed to understand the models.

Only the basic modules and classes should be provided to students. 
The aim it that they should build their own implementations of refence ML algorithms using a common API.

## Installation

`git clone https://github.com/vmspereira/si.git`

`cd si`

`pip install -e .`

## Folders organization

The _src_ folder contains the base source over which you will implement you code.

The _tests_ folder are python tests for continuous integration.

The _dataset_ folder contains some illustrative datasets.

The _script_ folder contains some notbooks to test your code.

## ML Algorithms

Standard Scaler
Variance Threshold
Select K-best

Principal Component Analysis
