# Intelligent Systems for Bioinformatics / Sistemas Inteligentes para Bioinformática

A library of algorithms to grasp essential concepts on a Machine Learning curriculum.
The code is commented with the mathematical fundations needed to understand how the algoritms and models work.
The first version of this repository was used as teaching tool in the Bioinformatics master at Universidade do Minho in 2021.

## Installation

`git clone https://github.com/vmspereira/si.git`

`cd si`

`pip install -e .`

## Folders organization

The _src_ folder contains the base source over which you will implement you code.

The _tests_ folder are python tests for continuous integration.

The _dataset_ folder contains some illustrative datasets.

The _script_ folder contains some notbooks to test your code.
